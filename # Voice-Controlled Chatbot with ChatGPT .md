 # Voice-Controlled Chatbot with ChatGPT and Speech Recognition

This project combines the power of ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model, with speech recognition to create a voice-controlled chatbot. The chatbot allows users to interact with ChatGPT using voice commands, making it a convenient and hands-free way to access information and engage in conversations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3 or higher
- SpeechRecognition library
- gtts (gTTS) library
- requests library
- mpg321 (for playing audio)

## Setting Up the Environment

1. Clone the project repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/helllopratik/emotion_chat_with_chatgpt
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd emotion_chat_with_chatgpt
```

3. Install the required Python libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Understanding the Code

The main Python script, `gpt.py`, contains the code for the voice-controlled chatbot. Let's break down the code step by step:

### 1. Importing Libraries

```python
import speech_recognition as sr
from gtts import gTTS
import os
import requests
```

These lines import the necessary libraries for speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, file manipulation, and making HTTP requests to the ChatGPT API.

### 2. Initializing Speech Recognizer

```python
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
```

This line initializes the speech recognition engine.

### 3. Function to Send Queries to ChatGPT

```python
def send_query_to_gpt(prompt):
    # Define the API endpoint and headers
    endpoint = "https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci/completions"
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_KEY"  # Replace with your API key
    }

    # Prepare the data to be sent
    data = {
        "prompt": prompt,
        "max_tokens": 150  # Adjust based on desired response
