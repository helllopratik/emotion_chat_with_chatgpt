### Here are two research paper topics, one for a 50% research paper and another for a 100% research paper, excluding the training data aspect:

1. **50% Research Paper Topic:**
   
   **Title:** "Enhancing Facial Emotion Detection in AI Chatbots using Real-time Emotion Recognition"
   
   **Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel approach to enhancing the conversational experience with AI chatbots by integrating real-time facial emotion recognition technology.
                 Leveraging pre-trained deep learning models for facial emotion detection, such as the IEMOCP dataset,
                 the system dynamically adapts its responses based on the user's detected emotional state. Through experiments and user studies,
                 2we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving user engagement and satisfaction in AI-driven conversational interfaces.

   **Key Components:**
   - Integration of real-time emotion recognition with AI chatbots.
   - Utilization of pre-trained models for facial emotion detection (e.g., IEMOCP dataset).
   - Evaluation through user studies and experiments to measure user engagement and satisfaction.
   - Comparison with traditional chatbot systems to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

3. **100% Research Paper Topic:**
   
   **Title:** "Exploring Multimodal Approaches for Emotion-aware Conversational Agents: A Deep Learning Perspective"
   
   **Abstract:** This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the development of multimodal conversational agents capable of understanding and responding to users' emotional cues.
                 Building upon recent advancements in deep learning and multimodal fusion techniques,
                 we propose a novel framework that combines text-based inputs with real-time facial emotion recognition to create emotion-aware conversational agents.
                 We conduct extensive experiments using diverse datasets, including the IEMOCP dataset, to evaluate the performance of our approach across various domains and interaction scenarios.
                 Our findings shed light on the potential of multimodal approaches in enhancing the emotional intelligence and naturalness of conversational agents,
                 paving the way for more immersive and empathetic human-machine interactions.

   **Key Components:**
   - Development of a multimodal conversational agent integrating text and facial emotion recognition.
   - Exploration of deep learning architectures for multimodal fusion and emotion prediction.
   - Evaluation of the proposed approach using diverse datasets and real-world interaction scenarios.
   - Analysis of user feedback and engagement metrics to assess the effectiveness and user acceptance of the multimodal conversational agent.
   - Discussion of potential applications and future directions for emotion-aware AI systems in various domains, such as healthcare, education, and entertainment.

These research paper topics leverage the existing capabilities of emotion detection in conversational AI systems and propose innovative approaches to enhance user experience and interaction quality.
