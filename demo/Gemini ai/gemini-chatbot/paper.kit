**Title: Emotion Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks for Language Models**

**Abstract:**
Emotion detection plays a crucial role in understanding human communication and interaction. With the increasing prevalence of language models (LMs) in various applications, integrating emotion detection capabilities into LMs can significantly enhance their performance and applicability. This research paper explores the utilization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for emotion detection in text data, specifically tailored for Language Models. We present a comprehensive review of existing methodologies, datasets, and evaluation metrics for emotion detection. We propose an architecture that leverages CNNs to extract features from textual input and classify emotions accurately. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of this emotion detection module into LMs to enable emotion-aware responses. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach in detecting emotions accurately, paving the way for more emotionally intelligent language models.
